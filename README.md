# TEnmo-VenmoClone-

A project that allows a user to log in, get authenticated, and transfer money to other users through MVC, RESTful API, and CLI.

Project completed along with fellow student Dughlas Hashbarger over five days as part of Tech Elevator's boot camp curriculem. We were tasked with writing a RESTful API server and command-line application as part of our 14-week Java bootcamp. Tech Elevator provided some starting code -- including all of the login and register functionality.

This project marked the end of our second module. You can learn more about Tech Elevator's coding bootcamps here: https://www.techelevator.com/.
